It's classical image processing method: applying of 2D filter on each pixel.
More about convolution matrix read: <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/en/plug-in-convmatrix.html">this</a>.
Main idea is the same as in other filters: each original samples gives some
value to common result but all of thees values has different amount which depend
of filter formula.

There are 2 main notes on this filter. First: no recursion, so original pixels
(samples) - are real original and temporary clean copy of original image should
be allocated and used for calculation. Second: normalization of result is need.
Result is divided by special value (div) and shifted by another (shift or bias).
And if now it's lesser then 0, 0 should be used instead of, if bigger then 255,
255 should be placed as result. 

This test uses convolution matrix to implement emboss filter. Other tests use
c.m. for other goals.
