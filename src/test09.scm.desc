This filter is based on c.m. filter also but instead of calculate
central point in filter window (in aperture) with special formula, it's sort
all points and use central point of sorted points and central point of window.
So, if there is big impulse in window's central point then it will be replaced
by "median" point. It's good to filter "salt and piper" noise.
