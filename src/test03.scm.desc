This is also simple algorithm which applies color mask on image:
with 3 bits user select one of 3 channels (R, G, B) to show, other
will be hidden. This looks like broken TV when picture is blown in
some color (green often). For example, bits "3" means "011", i.e.
R channel will be hidden, G, B - shown.
