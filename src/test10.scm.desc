This test makes dilation and erosion.

Dilation is - application of structural element (like kernel in c.m.)
on binary image to get more "fat" image. See more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilation_%28morphology%29">here</a>.

Erosion is - application of structural element (like kernel in c.m.)
on binary image to get more "thick" image. See more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion_%28morphology%29">here</a>.
